    details: "The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. Of the bodies that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the four gas and ice giants and the four terrestrial planets, followed by an unknown number of dwarf planets and innumerable small Solar System bodies. Of the bodies that orbit the Sun indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger than Mercury, the smallest terrestrial planet, and one is nearly as large.",

    details: "An atmosphere is a layer of gas or layers of gases that envelope a planet, that is held in place by the gravity of that body. The stratosphere extends from the top of the troposphere to the bottom of the mesosphere, and contains the ozone layer, at an altitude between 15 km and 35 km. It is the atmospheric layer that absorbs most of the ultraviolet radiation that Earth receives from the Sun.",

Wind and solar are increasingly popular sources of energy, but the sun does not always, and the wind doesn't always blow. So, what can replace fossil fuels to satisfy the increasing global need of energy?",
